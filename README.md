# Data-Persistence-Project
 
A completion of a Unity tutorial dealing with data persistence. The goal is to have scene data transfer 
scene to scene; and have data saved after a session is ended. The minigame used to demonstrate this 
is Arknoid (commonly known as BrickBreaker) in which you fire a ball at bricks and increase your
score by breaking the blocks. When all the bricks are gone; the game ends. 

## Getting Started

Clone the Github repo using ssh and open up the project in Unity

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

`
[Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download)
`

`
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
`

Download these and the run the installers. 

## Running the tests (W.I.P)

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

`
Give an example
`

### And coding style tests

The Editorconfig dictates the style the code should be in. It is loosely 
based off of my research of the C# compiler's preferred options. 

### Brand new Implemented Features

[X] Main Menu with start button added

[X] Quit Button on Main Mneu

[X] Player's name persists across scenes

[X] Player name displayed with the score

[X] Top High Scores persists across sessions

[X] Top High score displays the name
